###  A [GriefPrevention](https://modrinth.com/plugin/griefprevention) addon where new claims remember who you trusted.

---
Hate having to retrust your friends every time you make a new claim? This addon solves this!

**How does it work?** Whenever a player creates a claim, qGPTrust looks at their previously created claim, and copies those trusted players to the new claim making sure to maintain proper trust-level.

Just drop it in and it works!


---

After creating a claim, the creator will be notified how many players were auto-trusted to their new claim to prevent any confusion.
